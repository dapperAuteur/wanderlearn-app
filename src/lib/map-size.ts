/**
 * How big the tour's mini-map should be, for a given viewport width.
 *
 * It used to be a flat 180px. On a 375px phone that is 48% of the screen
 * width sitting on top of the photograph — the mini-map is an orientation
 * aid, and at that size it competes with the thing it is meant to help you
 * look at. On a wide desktop the same 180px is unremarkable, which is why the
 * problem was easy to miss.
 *
 * The steps are deliberately coarse. A continuously-scaling size would need
 * recomputing on every resize frame for a control most visitors glance at
 * twice; three buckets get the same result and only change when the viewport
 * crosses a breakpoint.
